# planets

###Read all these instructions before continuing. 

Your assignment is to add a new file to this repository.  

First think of a planet (real or fictional).  Visit the pull request tab to see what others are submitting -- attempt to not use the same planetname!

Next, click the "Create new file" button above.

Github will warn you that you don't have write access to this repository.  But, it will give you a page where you can name your file:  make it ```yourplanetname.txt```  where you replace ```yourplanetname``` with the planet of your choosing.

Add some content to your file about your planet.  (See ```gallifrey.txt``` for an example.)

Put some informative information in the comment box at the bottom (this is your commit message).

Click "Propose new file"

On the next screen click "Create pull request".  If all goes well, you will see a screen where you can edit your message to the repository maintainer and then click "Create pull request" to finish. 

The maintainer will get notified of your pull request.  

When you're finished, visit the pull request tab to see that your request is there.
